                    <p> The Home Security Advisor named Bolingbrook in annual Illinois’s Safest Cities Report</p>


                    <p>
                        Bolingbrook, IL: Bolingbrook has been named as one of the Top 50 Safest Cities in Illinois in the 2019 report published by The
                        Home Security Advisor. The article and a full listing can be found at
                        https://www.thehomesecurityadvisor.com/safest-cities-illinois/.</p>



                    <p>A leader in the home security and personal safety industry, the site proclaims:



                        “In our experience the towns, cities and communities listed in our Top 50 share a number of qualities of which their residents
                        should be proud.</p>


                    <ul>
                        <li>Strong Leadership</li>
                        <li> Dedicated Law Enforcement</li>
                        <li>Active Citizenship</li>

                    </ul>
                    These are the key ingredients that combine to make these communities among the safest and most desirable places to reside and
                    raise a family.”
                    <p>The Home Security Advisor rankings were calculated using the 2016 FBI Uniform Crime Report results with respect to towns and
                        cities with Five-thousand residents or higher, who reported their crime data. These figures were weighted in order to
                        accurately indicate the seriousness of the criminal activity. Violent crimes were factored by .60 and property crimes by .40.
                        This number would be then divided by the population in the community and normalized to reflect weighted criminal offenses per
                        100,000.</p>

                    History of Bolingbrook
                </div>
                <p>The modern Village of Bolingbrook got its start in the first half of the 1960s when the first builder laid out the first housing
                    tract in the farm fields just north of old U.S. 66 and beside Illinois Route 53.</p>

                <p> Those first families, as they moved in, had never heard or seen the name "Bolingbrook". Where they were moving was known as
                    "Westbury" they thought, which, as it turned out, was just the first west side unit of what was "Bolingbrook Subdivision", as
                    recorded by Dover Construction Company at the county.</p>

                <p style="display: inline;">The young families, for the most part, were lured out to model homes by advertisements that featured a handsome and distinguished
                    British butler named Mr. Dover. They come via the Stevenson Expressway, as the new and improved Route 66 had been renamed. It was
                    the long umbilical cord that stretched out from the city of Chicago to the far west farmlands. The first model homes went up on
                    Rocklyn Court, off Route 53, just north of the current Pheasant Hill shopping center.</p><span id="dots1">...</span>

                <span class="more" id="more1">
                    Homes were priced at $10,000 with as little as $200 down. The first homes ready for families to move into were on Avondale
                        Court,
                        just west of Route 53 and north of Briarcliff Road. Lesson #1 learned the hard way through teary eyes: everything you see in
                        the
                        model home isn't in your finished house, necessarily. In the case of Dover homes that meant no carpeting or even floor tile in
                        some area unless you paid extra. And there certainly were no trees or lawns. And not always paved streets.</p>

                    <p> Dover Construction Company also designed two other areas to follow Westbury, the two subsequent areas both east of Route 53,
                        but
                        still centered around the Dover-built Briarcliff Road. While Westbury had the first homes, the east side's Colonial Village
                        became
                        the site of the first churches, parks, fire station and, eventually, Village Hall and jail.</p>

                    <p>The three original home tracts - sold from 1961 to 1965 under the names of Westbury, Colonial Village and King's Park were all
                        part
                        of the original "Bolingbrook Subdivision."</p>

                    <p>It was these homes, and the families in them that officially formed the Village of Bolingbrook in 1965 with incorporation.</p>
