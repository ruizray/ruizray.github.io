		The Sister City relationships Bolingbrook has developed across the world with China, India, the Philippines, Pakistan and now with Brazzaville,
		Republic of the Congo - in poetic terms are like brilliant jewels adorning our multifaceted community crown. Bolingbrook is a community distinguished
		by its ethnic diversity and unprecedented level of inclusiveness. If our neighborhoods could speak they would say, “Hate has NO Home Here!” At
		Bolingbrook’s founding, in 1965, the Village was little more than land surrounded by a sea of cornfields. Like waves in the ocean, each successive
		decade has opened the floodgates to diverse ethnic tides. Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar comments, “I am proud of the ways diverse residents
		representing a range of races, creeds and colors have stepped forward and taken the lead in developing “Sister City” relationships. Dr. Sylvere
		Malonga follows in the footsteps of fellow residents who have coordinated Bolingbrook delegations to grace the soil of their home countries. These
		actions by extension have proven effective avenues for trade and tolerance.” Sister City agreements are in line with the ethnic evolution of
		Bolingbrook. Between our boundaries, a rich tapestry of cultures unfold that are interwoven by threads of service and strengthened by residents that
		hail from almost every continent in the world. Although Bolingbrook’s various cultural groups arrived in waves, they settled un-cloistered in
		subdivisions throughout the Village. The determination of destination had nothing to do with race or origin. Neighborhoods evolved organically. As a
		result, racial, religious and cultural tolerance are not ideals to strive for… they are the norm and as such represent Bolingbrook’s inherent value.
		The Village of Bolingbrook embraces the Sister City concept because it captures the Spirit of America.

			Brazzaville’s recorded start arrived during the 19th Century “Scramble for Africa” when the French Colonial Empire claimed and named it after
			Italo-French Explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza who founded Brazzaville in 1880. Brazzaville is a city populated by 1.8 million residents,
			situated on the north side of the Congo River. Brazzaville stands in stark contrast to its counterpart, Kinshasa, a megacity of 11 million people
			that lies on the southern bank of the Congo River. There is a sizeable distinction between the two African countries with “Congo” in their names.
			Interestingly, Brazzaville is the only place in the world where two national capital cities are on opposite banks of a river, within plain sight
			of each other. Brazzaville is the capital and largest city in the Republic of Congo. It has emerged as the country’s financial and administrative
			home. Brazzaville has gained a good reputation for its safe and relatively laid back atmosphere. Brazzaville’s location and “business friendly
			persona” have enabled it to grow as an industrial, trading and port settlement. Brazzaville’s industries run the gamut - yet primarily consist of
			manufacturing and machine shops. As a key port on the Congo River, Brazzaville takes deliveries of raw materials such as rubber wood and
			agricultural products prior to export. Within a century, Brazzaville became “the place” to establish a regional office for businesses, government
			and non-profit organizations. A few examples include the World Health Organization, the Nabemba Tower, the Congressional Palace, the Equatorial
			Congo Airlines and the United States Embassy for the Republic of the Congo.
