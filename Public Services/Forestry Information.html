                <p> The Village of Bolingbrook has over 40,000 trees planted in parkways and medians. It is vital that
                    the Village
                    of Bolingbrook its arborists and foresters on staff continually inspect these trees for disease,
                    pests, and
                    damage to maintain a healthy urban forest. These trees as well as the trees in our green spaces and
                    along our
                    waterways, help clean the air, provide oxygen, and help prevent erosion.</p>

                <p>The Village of Bolingbrook does not maintain trees on private property. A tree removal permit is
                    needed to
                    remove a tree on private property. A Village forester will inspect the permit and the tree(s) to be
                    removed. No
                    permit is needed to trim trees on private property.</p>

                    Tree Pruning
                </div>
                <p>Pruning is a necessary part of maintaining a healthy tree. Proper pruning will enhance the health and
                    vigor a tree by removing dead and diseased limbs, overcrowded and crossing limbs, increasing airflow
                    to minimize the risk of infection as well as increasing the overall appearance of the tree. The
                    Forestry Department conducts seasonal block tree trimming. The Village continually inspects to
                    determine the areaâ€™s most in need of trimming, with work typically beginning in early winter and
                    lasting through spring. In addition to block tree trimming, the Village of Bolingbrook has certified
                    arborists on staff to respond to year long trimming requests due to storms, emergencies, line of
                    sight issues, and overall appearance.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Parkway trees are continually viewed year round for removal. Factors to determine if a tree will
                    need to be
                    removed include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The tree is infested or diseased.</li>

                    <li> The tree is dead or declining.</li>

                    <li> The tree poses a safety risk to pedestrians, vehicles, or buildings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a tree is marked for removal, a Village crew or approved contractor will remove the tree(s) and
                    grind the
                    stump. The Village crew or approved contractor will remove the grindings from the stump and the
                    parkway will be
                    restored with soil and seed at a later date.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When a tree is removed in most cases it will be replaced, however, a village forester will inspect
                    the site to
                    determine if the tree will be replaced. Factors to determine if a tree will be planted include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Overall site conditions of the planting site.</li>

                    <li> Spacing between existing trees.</li>

                    <li> Distance from intersections, road signs, and utilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Newly planted trees are typically 2.5-3 inches in diameter, and vary in species. The Village strives
                    to plant a
                    variety of species and cultivars to lessen the impact of future disease and pest outbreaks.</p>

                    Care Of Newly Planted Trees
                </div>
                <p>Newly planted trees require adequate watering. Please water your tree once a week for the first year
                    following planting, about 10 gallons at a time, which is equivalent to a slow trickle from a hose
                    for about one hour. If we receive an inch of rain during that week, it will not be necessary to
                    water. Trees can suffer from over-watering too, especially when using your sprinkler system. Trees
                    and grass are healthier with weekly deep-watering rather than frequent watering. The Village or
                    approved contractor will place mulch around the base of the newly planted trees. This mulch is
                    beneficial in many ways; it helps to conserve moisture, it helps to reduce weed competition, and
                    helps to prevent damage to the base of tree.</p>

                    <p>Emerald ash borer is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near
                        Detroit in the summer of 2002. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage.
                        The larvae feed on the inner bark of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.
                        The Village of Bolingbrook has removed over 9,300 Ash trees due to Emerald Ash Borer.
                        <strong>The Village no longer treats Ash trees for EAB.</strong>

                        Toronto. The Asian long horned beetle kills a wide variety of hardwood trees, especially maples, elms, willows, and birches.

                    <p>Adult Japanese beetles are 7/16-inch long metallic green beetles with
                        copper-brown wing
                        covers. Japanese beetles feed on about 300 species of plants, devouring leaves, flowers, and
                        overripe or wounded
                        fruit. They usually feed in groups, starting at the top of a plant and working downward. The beetles
                        are most
                        active on warm, sunny days, and prefer plants that are in direct sunlight. Adults feed on the upper
                        surface of
                        foliage, chewing out tissue between the leaf veins. This gives the leaf a lacelike or skeletonized
                        appearance.
                        Trees that are severely injured appear to have been scorched by fire. Japanese beetles may
                        completely consume
                        rose petals and leaves with delicate veins.
