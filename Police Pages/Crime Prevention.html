                <p>
                    One of the more frequent crimes reported to the police department is burglary to a vehicle.
                    Sometimes
                    offenders enter a vehicle through an unlocked door or by breaking a window looking for valuables
                    that are
                    left in plain view. Some of the most popular items stolen are briefcases, cameras, cell phones,
                    global
                    positioning systems (GPS), I-Passes, I-Pods, purses, radar detectors, and wallets.</p><p>Here are some
                simple rules that can help deter and protect you from being a victim of this crime.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        When you park your vehicle at home or away, close your windows and lock doors, even if you’re
                        going to be
                        gone for a short time.</li>
                    Remove and secure all valuables, including garage door opens & electronic accessories (GPS window
                    brackets &
                    power cords).
                    <li>Always park in a well lit area.</li>
                    <li>If you have a garage, use it! If you have to park your vehicle in your driveway overnight, leave on
                    exterior
                    house lights. Good lighting is one of the most efficient & least expensive means of security.</li>
                    <li>Notify the police department of any suspicious people or activities in your neighborhood.</li>
                </ul>
