                <p>Vax Up Bolingbrook is an initiative by Mayor Mary Alexander-Basta and the Village of Bolingbrook aiming to provide COVID-19
                    Vaccinations and resources to Bolingbrook residents by partnering with health departments, pharmacies, and other public safety
                    officials.

                <p style="font-weight:700">
                    Any information regarding official Village sponsored vaccination clinics will be updated here:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our number one priority was to confirm that all our Bolingbrook senior living facilities have been provided the vaccine. We are
                    happy to announce that as of this week, all of their residents were given the opportunity to get vaccinated. Our focus now will
                    shift to senior residents that do not live in these facilities.<br>
                    After consistent and constant communication with health departments and other providers, Bolingbrook is on track to host
                    vaccination clinics. <span style="font-weight:700">We are still waiting to secure a supply of vaccine</span>. We anticipate the
                    Village to host the first community vaccination clinic in the <span style="font-weight:700">coming weeks</span>.
