                    Carbon Monoxide Detector Law
                </div>
                <p>Effective January 1, 2007, every dwelling unit will be required to have at least one approved carbon
                    monoxide alarm in an operating condition within 15 feet of every room used for sleeping purposes.
                    Alarms can be battery powered, plug-in with battery back-up or wired into the AC power line with a
                    secondary battery back-up. The alarm can be combined with smoke detecting devices if the combined
                    unit complies with specific standards and the alarm differentiates the hazard.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <div class="subHead">
                        The Law
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Illinois General Assembly has passed and the Govenor has signed the Carbon Monoxide Alarm
                        Detector Act (Public Act 094-0741). This new law, effective January 1, 2007, requires homeowners
                        and
                        landlords to install carbon monoxide detectors in all buildings containing bedrooms and sleeping
                        facilities.</p>
                    The Primary Features of the Law are:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every "dwelling unit" must be equipped with at least one operable carbon monoxide alarm
                            within 15
                            feet of every room used for sleeping purposes.</li>
                        <li> The alarm may be combined with smoke detecting devices provided the unit complies with
                            respective
                            standards and the alarm differentiates the hazard.</li>
                        <li> A "dwelling unit" means a room or suite of rooms used for human habitation, and includes
                            single
                            family residences, multiple family residences and mixed use buildings.</li>
                        <li> If a structure contains more than one "dwelling unit," an alarm must be installed within 15
                            feet of
                            every sleeping room in each "dwelling unit."</li>
                        <li> The owner must supply and install all required alarms. A landlord must ensure that the
                            alarms are
                            operable on the date of initiation of a lease. The tenant is responsible for testing and
                            maintaining
                            the alarm after the lease commences.</li>
                        <li> A landlord is required to furnish one tenant per dwelling unit with written information
                            regarding
                            alarm testing and maintenance.</li>
                        Willful failure to install and maintain in operating condition any alarm is a Class B criminal
                        misdemeanor.</li>
                        <li> The Act does exempt certain residential units from the requirement. Those residential units
                            in a
                            building that (1) does not rely on combustion of fossil fuel for heat, ventilation or hot
                            water and
                            (2) is not connected to a garage.</li>

                        on the traditional smoke alarm to alert them to a fire.<br>

                    Wireless Alarm Monitoring
                </div>
                <p>The Village of Bolingbrook implemented the wireless fire alarm monitoring for commercial and
                    multifamily occupancies in 2008. This system is replacing an existing monitoring system that is over
                    25 years old with newer, less expensive and a more reliable system. This is a cost effective,
                    reliable fire alarm protection system that will transmit fire alarms through a wireless mesh
                    network. Any power loss by the radios are reported automatically to the Wescom Dispatch Center,
                    which is operated by 911 dispatchers, 24 hours a day. There is no third party processing the
                    alarm.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <div class="subHead">How Wireless Alarm Monitoring affects you</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Eliminates the need for expensive dedicated phone lines</li>
                        <li> Reduces the number of false alarms from phone line ground faults</li>
                        <li> Ensures a higher degree of reliability during storm conditions</li>
                        <li> Over nine (9) years of proven reliability</li>
                        <li> All equipment is U.L. Listed; National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) compliant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The total monthly monitoring cost is $86 per month. Since the system has been implemented, there
                        has
                        been no rate increase in monthly monitoring fees.
