                <p>The Bolingbrook Fire Department Training Division develops, implements and maintains programs that support the safe and effective
                    operations for our personnel. The Training Division oversees the suppression, safety and officer development programs and works in
                    conjunction with out MABAS (Mutual Aid Box Alarm) Division 16 fire departments. The Training Division is comprised of one
                    Battalion Chief full time and three front-line Lieutenants who focus on training as an ancillary assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    The Training Battalion Chief develops a monthly schedule and training packet for the department. Our goal is to reinforce existing
                    skills, introduce new equipment, maintain state mandated training objectives and utilize computer simulations to prepare our
                    personnel for emergencies they will be confronted with. The majority of our training is completed at the station level being
                    instructed by the Lieutenants and Upgrade Company Officers. Specialized topics including technical rescue, hazardous materials and
                    water rescue are conducted with our MABAS 16 departments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Members of the Bolingbrook Fire Department become certified at the state level by meeting criteria developed by the Illinois
                    Officer of the State Fire Marshal. The Training Division is committed to meeting or exceeding those fire service industry
                    standards. The department is fortunate to count among its employees several such certified and qualified instructors. New recruits
                    to the Bolingbrook Fire Department complete a 4 week orientation program and are assigned a Lieutenant for their probationary
                    period of 1 year. They complete a 4 month and a 10 month skills evaluation as well as start preparing themselves for driving of
                    fire apparatus. Each new member is required to be a state certified Advanced Firefighter within 5 years of employment.
                </p>
