                <p>As the Village grows, so does the demand for Emergency Medical Services. In 2011, the Bolingbrook
                    Fire Department saw 4,302 EMS related patients. The daily EMS Division operations are run by EMS
                    Director, Lt. Todd Nemeth. The EMS division is responsible for coordinating the activities of
                    all
                    certified paramedics and EMT's. This includes the design and implementation of all continuing
                    education, certification of all ambulances, maintenance of medical records, and coordinating
                    between
                    the Illinois Department of Public Health and local hospital.

                    Becoming an EMT
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The initial education for EMT's is usually conducted through the local community college. It
                    consists of one semester of classroom with 16 hours of working in the emergency room and on an
                    ambulance. Upon completion of these requirements, the individual completes the state exam for
                    licensing. In the field, EMT's are required to perform 30 hours of documented continuing education
                    per year.<br>
                    To become a paramedic, an individual must complete the EMT-Basic course and apply for the paramedic
                    program through a resource hospital like Edward, Good Sam, Loyola, etc. The student will study
                    topics of cardiology, pharmacology, anatomy and physiology, advanced trauma life-support, and
                    pediatric advanced life-support. The student spends six months doing clinical rotations in various
                    departments of the hospital and 400 hours of field operations in the ambulance.<br>

                    Upon successful completion of the course, the individual must pass the state exam for licensing. The
                    paramedic must then pass an entrance exam in the Emergency Medical System in which he/she plans to
                    operate. Once operational, the paramedic must perform 30 hours of continuing education per year.
                    Currently, all the members of the Fire Department field staff are EMS trained. The department
                    currently has 63 EMT-P (Paramedics) and 23 EMT-B (EMT Basics)<br></p>

                </h1>
                Over the past ten years, the Bolingbrook Fire Department has been involved in the Paramedic
                Preceptor program through the Edward Hospital EMS system. A Preceptor is a Paramedic who volunteers
                his/her time to field train a Paramedic student by giving them the ability to ride along with the
                Paramedic and to participate in the care (under the paramedics guidance) and transport of a patient.
                They also help the student with their studies by answering questions, dealing with patient care,
                Standard Operating Procedures, policies and ECG recognition.</p>

                    Medication Disposal
                </h1>
                <p> If you have expired drugs or medications that you no longer use, do you know the proper way to
                    dispose of them?

                    According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) most drugs can be thrown in the trash, but
                    certain precautions should be taken before tossing them out.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Follow any specific disposal instructions on the drug label or patient information that
                        accompanies
                        the medication.</li>
                    <li>Only flush the medications that are on the <a
                           href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm#MEDICINES">medications
                            recommended for disposal by flushing
                            list</a>.
                        This list, from FDA, tells you what expired, unwanted, or unused medicines you should flush
                        down the
                        sink or toilet to help prevent danger to people and pets in the home. Flushing these
                        medicines will
                        get rid of them right away and help keep your family and pets safe. The FDA continually
                        evaluates
                        medicines for safety risks and will update the list as needed.</li>
                    <li>Take them out of their original containers and mix them with an undesirable substance, such
                        as used
                        coffee grounds or kitty litter. Put them in a sealable bag, empty can or other container to
                        prevent
                        the medication from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to scratch out all identifying information on the prescription label to make it
                        unreadable. This will help protect your identity and the privacy of your personal health
                        information.</li>
