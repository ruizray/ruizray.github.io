                    <p>Bolingbrook Fire Department ambulances transport to local hospitals. That may mean that an ambulance may not be close to your
                        house when you request our services. The fire truck may be the closest unit and can start lifesaving procedures prior to the
                        arrival of an ambulance from another fire station. All of our fire trucks are equipped with EMT's, capable of basic lifesaving
                        techniques and some of our fire trucks are equipped with paramedics and the capability of performing advanced lifesaving
                        techniques prior to the arrival of an ambulance.</p>
