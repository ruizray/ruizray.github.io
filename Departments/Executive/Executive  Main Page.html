                    <p>
                        Welcome to the Bolingbrook Executive Department website. As a resident of Bolingbrook since 2003
                        and
                        Mayor
                        since August 1, 2020, I am honored and thrilled to be serving as the Mayor of the Village of
                        Bolingbrook. I
                        believe strongly in our motto, &#8220;A Place to Grow&#8221;. Not only have I personally experienced this
                        with
                        my
                        family
                        in Bolingbrook, I have seen this motto be demonstrated by our residents, businesses, and
                        community.
                    </p>




                    <p> The Executive Department exists to handle the day to day operations of the village, and my goal
                        is
                        to
                        ensure
                        that our staff follows that motto. The department continues to move forward by constantly
                        collaborating
                        with
                        all other village departments, reviewing where we&#8217;ve been and where we&#8217;re going, and
                        communicating
                        with
                        our
                        residents. I believe in an open door policy. I want to have open lines of communication and
                        welcome
                        anyone
                        who would like to meet with me to either call, email, or come in to the village office.</p>
