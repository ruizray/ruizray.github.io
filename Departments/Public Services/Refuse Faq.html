                    <h4 class="subHead">Why can't garbage costs be kept on the property tax bill?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most households generate about the same amount of waste. Therefore, a house worth $500,000 would pay five times as much as the
                        $100,000 homeowner for the same service. The Village will now do direct billing and all households will be invoiced the same
                        monthly charge. In addition to the “fairness issue” just mentioned, residents have expressed concerns about high real estate
                        taxes for years and don’t want their property taxes to go up. The trend in government is to go to user fees. With the current
                        “cap” on SALT (sales and local taxes) deductions on federal income taxes, people can no longer write off property taxes in
                        excess of the cap. Only one other suburban city out of over 286 suburbs, have garbage on the tax bill.

                    <h4 class="subHead">Can't a flat rate charge be added to the property tax bill?</h4>
                    <p>
                        No, real estate taxes are based on levies and assessed valuations. There is not a way to levy a flat charge on the property
                        tax bill.

                    <h4 class="subHead">When was the garbage fee removed from my tax bill?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The garbage fee was removed (last year) from the 2017 tax bill payable in 2018. Last year, the Village absorbed the $5million
                        charge. Garbage collection costs are not on your current tax bill.

                    <h4 class="subHead">How much is the refuse charge per month?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The refuse charge per month is $20.19 per household. This is the amount Groot charges whether the bill is paid through taxes
                        or direct billing. It is the same amount it was when it was on your tax bill.

                    <p>
                        There is a $2.00 service fee per billing cycle. This service fee is to cover additional personnel and administrative costs
                        such as invoice and mail processing.

                    <p>
                        The Bolingbrook “Good Neighbor” Rent Lease Program requires all landlords to have a valid
                        license from the Village of Bolingbrook. All requirements can be found at

                    <h4 class="subHead">How do other communities charge for garbage pick-up?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The vast majority of communities have garbage charges included on the water/sewer bill. Other communities have the waste
                        hauler bill the resident direct. There is only one other suburb that the Village is aware of that has garbage collection on
                        the real estate tax bill. Whether garbage collection provided by a 3rd party is deductible is subject to debate.

                        Yes, you can prepay the monthly/quarterly charge. If a resident prepays the year in advance only one administrative fee will
                        be applied. The total amount for 1 year is $244.28.
