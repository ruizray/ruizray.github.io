            <p>A native Ohioan, Marti Barton moved to Bolingbrook with her family in 1987, having been attracted to the village by its diversity and
                reasonably-priced housing options. Marti stepped right into public service providing auxiliary communications as a licensed ham radio
                operator during the Plainfield tornado disaster in 1990, and has been serving the community ever since.</p>
            <p>
                She is a widow, after being married to her late husband Keith Barton for 28 years. She has four adult children/stepchildren, a
                daughter-in-law, and two beautiful granddaughters, who all live in the area.
