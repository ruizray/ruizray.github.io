            <p>Mary and her husband, Dr. Emad Basta, moved to Bolingbrook in November 2003. They are parents of two sons, Peter (16) and Benjamin (14). Bolingbrook was their choice, because of its diversity, its opportunities to serve and for all of the amenities that others have also found attractive about the community. While she found her career challenging and satisfying, she and her husband also wanted to raise a family here. Since a position in the hospitality industry was not a nine to five job, she left the corporate world to start a family. As her children grew, Mary found herself seeking more adult interaction, so she looked for ways to get involved, which led her to serving in the PTA. In all of her activities, both professional and community service, Mary enjoys problem-solving; finding ways to work smarter, not harder; and to take them to the next level of success.</p>
