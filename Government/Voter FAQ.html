                <p><b>Dear Neighbors,</b></p>
                <p>
                    As you may know, the April 6, 2021 Consolidated Election in the Village of Bolingbrook is approaching and, for the first time in
                    recent history, there will be three (3) referenda questions for our consideration. All of the referenda questions are non-binding,
                    “advisory” questions, but two of them, concerning video gaming and the use of hotel/motel tax, will be important to help assist
                    the Village in making certain policy determinations in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    On behalf of the Village, I am writing to provide factual information so that each question may be easily understood. <b>It is
                        important to note that the Village takes no official position as to any support or opposition to the referenda and this letter
                        is
                        not intended in any way to advocate for you to vote “for” or “against” any of the questions</b>. My hope is that this letter
                    will
                    assist you and your family in making an informed choice when you go to the polls. The three questions will be described in turn.

                </p>
                <div id="indent" class="subsection">
                    <h4 class="subHead">1. “Shall the Village of Bolingbrook rescind the approximately 40% tax increase for fees to collect garbage?”
                        (Citizen-Initiated)</h4>
                    <p>This question was initiated by a petition filed with the Village Clerk’s Office and is a non-binding, advisory question. The
                        Village does not currently levy a “tax” to collect garbage; refuse collection has always been paid as a fee for services. This
                        question is likely referencing the fact that the fees for garbage collection service were previously reflected and paid
                        directly through individual property tax bills but are now billed separately. The garbage collection fee in 2017 was $19.40
                        per household and was $20.59 per household in 2020. Therefore, Residents still pay a fee for garbage service and that fee has
                        NOT increased by 40% — the issue is with the manner in which the fees are billed. The Village will continue the equitable
                        calculation and collection of garbage fees, and not put the fee back on the property tax bills. The Village will continue its
                        work in exploring additional options for garbage collection service, and I have established a committee to study options with
                        respect to the garbage service and, in particular, garbage toters or cart options and direct resident billing from the refuse
                        hauler.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        It is important to know that the Village is unable to “rescind” a “tax increase” that never happened. As the Village had no
                        role in preparing and submitting this referendum question, there was no ability to make modifications to ensure a clear,
                        accurate question. The Village takes no position on how to vote for this referendum question but found it important to provide
                        factual information as to how garbage services are billed. The Village will continue to work hard for all of its residents to
                        ensure garbage service is provided in the most efficient and beneficial manner while keeping costs down to a minimum.</p>

                    <h4 class="subHead">2. Shall the Village of Bolingbrook allow video gaming to operate within the Village of Bolingbrook?</h4>
                    <p>This question was initiated by Village Board resolution and is asking a non-binding, advisory question to gauge public opinion
                        concerning whether the Village should allow certain businesses to have video gaming (gambling) terminals. The Village has been
                        reluctant to allow video gaming in the past but seeks resident input regarding same. Video gaming is allowed under the
                        Illinois “Video Gaming Act,” which authorizes the placement of Video Gaming Terminals (VGTs) in certain, licensed Retail
                        Establishments, Truck Stops, Veteran and Fraternal Establishments. The VGTs are all connected and monitored by a Central
                        Communication System overseen by the State. Should video gaming be allowed, the Village would retain some control over the
                        regulation of the practice and, in particular, where gaming would be permitted pursuant to local ordinance. The arguments
                        against video gaming generally reflect concern with the possible changing the nature and character of businesses (i.e.,
                        restaurants) and possible, perceived problems that legalized gambling could bring. Proponents would likely argue that the
                        potential revenue for businesses and the Village from video gaming is very strong and would present a possible method to
                        provide needed relief to local restaurant and other businesses affected by the Pandemic, and that the Village should allow its
                        businesses to retain a competitive advantage against neighboring communities that allow video gaming. Again, the Village takes
                        no position either way and is seeking the input of our voters in order to plan potential policy initiatives in the future.

                    <h4 class="subHead">3. Shall the Village of Bolingbrook use hotel/motel tax revenue to promote tourism, and to support local
                        leisure, recreational and cultural programs and events?</h4>
                    <p>This question was also initiated by Village Board resolution and is asking a non-binding, advisory question to gauge public
                        opinion concerning the possible dedication of certain tax revenues specifically to support local leisure, recreational, and
                        cultural programming and events. The Village currently levies a hotel/motel tax, and the question is asking whether Village
                        residents believe a portion of those funds (derived from overnight room rental at hotels and motels) should be allocated by
                        the Village to promote tourism, to fund recreational activities, and to fund other local events and programming. Again, the
                        Village takes no position either way and is looking for the residents’ input in order to plan potential policy initiatives in

                    As Mayor, I felt it imperative to include all of our residents in the discussion concerning these referenda questions. Your vote
